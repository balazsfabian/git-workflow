## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## Basic Concepts of Git
Possible status of files in a version-controlled folder:
- Untracked: a file that is not version controlled
- Unmodified: a version controlled file without changes
- Modified: a version controlled file with changes
- Staged: a changed or new file to be commited
